A Professional and Secure Utility for Media Acquisition
This software suite provides a robust, self-contained solution for downloading audio and video content from various online sources. Designed for efficiency and ease of use, it is packaged as a standalone executable to simplify deployment and operation for end-users.

üõ†Ô∏è Core Components and Functionality
The Get-Media Suite is a powerful, integrated system composed of three primary components:

Get-Audio.py (Core Application): This is the central Python script that serves as the main application. It features two key capabilities:

YouTube Audio Extraction: It efficiently identifies and downloads the highest available audio stream from any specified YouTube video URL.

Web Scraper: It can systematically scan a given URL to locate and download embedded audio files (e.g., .mp3, .wav).

Youtube-Video-downloader.c (Installer Utility): A custom C-based installer that manages dependencies. It automatically verifies and, if necessary, acquires elevated administrator privileges to install FFmpeg via the Chocolatey package manager, a critical dependency for media conversion and processing.

setup.py (Distribution Script): A Python script that utilizes cx_Freeze to bundle the core application, the installer utility, and all necessary dependencies into a single, portable .exe file. This process creates a self-contained executable that simplifies distribution and eliminates the need for manual dependency management by the end-user.

üöÄ Usage Instructions
Operating the Get-Media Suite is designed to be straightforward. Follow these steps to begin:

Execute the Installer: Run the admin_installer.exe file first. This one-time step will automatically install the necessary FFmpeg utility to your system.

Launch the Application: After the installer completes, run the Get-Audio.exe executable. A command-line interface will appear with a menu of options.

Follow the Prompts: Select your desired function from the menu and provide the requested URL. The software will handle the download and conversion process.
